    "with replacement from a set of data points\n",
    "• Substituting labels on data points when performing significance tests\n",
    "• Validating models by using random subsets (bootstrapping, cross-validation)\n",
    "147. What is selection bias?\n",
    "Selection bias, in general, is a problematic situation in which error is introduced due to a non-random\n",
    "population sample.\n",
    "148. What are the types of biases that can occur during sampling?\n",
    "1. Selection bias\n",
    "2. Undercoverage bias\n",
    "3. Survivorship bias\n",
    "149. What is survivorship bias?\n",
    " \n",
    "Survivorship bias is the logical error of focusing on aspects that support surviving a process and casually\n",
    "overlooking those that did not because of their lack of prominence. This can lead to wrong conclusions in\n",

    "150. How do you work towards a random forest?\n",
    "The underlying principle of this technique is that several weak learners combine to provide a strong\n",
    "learner. The steps involved are:\n",
    "1. Build several decision trees on bootstrapped training samples of data\n",
    "2. On each tree, each time a split is considered, a random sample of mm predictors is chosen as split\n",
    "candidates out of all pp predictors\n",
    "3. Rule of thumb: At each split m=p√m=p\n",
    "4. Predictions: At the majority rule\n",

    "The following are some of the important skills to possess which will come handy when performing data\n",
    "analysis using Python.\n",
    "• Good understanding of the built-in data types especially lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets.\n",
    "• Mastery of N-dimensional NumPy Arrays.\n",
    "• Mastery of Pandas dataframes.\n",
    "• Ability to perform element-wise vector and matrix operations on NumPy arrays.\n",
    "• Knowing that you should use the Anaconda distribution and the conda package manager.\n",
    "• Familiarity with Scikit-learn. **Scikit-Learn Cheat Sheet**\n",
