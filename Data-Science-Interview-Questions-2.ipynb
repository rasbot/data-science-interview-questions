    " \n",
    " \n",
    "are not always de-allocated or freed. It is impossible to de-allocate those portions of \n",

    "like it copies the values. \n",
    "Deep copy is used to store the values that are already copied. Deep copy doesn’t copy \n",

    " \n",
    " \n",
    "Neither the arguments are Pass by Value nor does Python supports Pass by reference. \n",
    "Instead, they are Pass by assignment. The parameter which you pass is originally a \n",

    "passed by value. Additionally, some data types like strings and tuples are immutable \n",
    "whereas others are mutable. \n",

    "73. What is namespace in Python? \n",
    "In Python, every name introduced has a place where it lives and can be hooked for. This \n",
    "is known as namespace. It is like a box where a variable name is mapped to the object \n",
